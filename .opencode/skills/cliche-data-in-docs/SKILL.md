# Using Cliche Data in Documentation

When writing documentation, **never include real data** from your codebase, configuration, or task context. Documentation must use only generic, commonly recognized placeholder data.

## Why This Matters

Your source code and local configuration often contain:
- Real names and email addresses
- Real organization details
- Real domain names
- Client or customer identifiers
- Account names and credentials

These values are necessary for your code to function, but they have **no place in public-facing documentation**. Leaking real data into docs can expose sensitive information.

## The Core Rule

> **If data came from a prompt, a local file, a script, a config, or a task — it does NOT go into documentation.**
>
> Documentation examples use only well-known, fictional, or obviously placeholder data.

## What Counts as Real Data

Any value that originates from:

- **Local configuration files** (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`, account modules)
- **Scripts and task files** (e.g., batch scripts, shell scripts, task runners)
- **Prompt context** (e.g., data the user supplies when asking an agent to build or update the tool)
- **Map or filter files** (e.g., JSON mappings, data extraction rules)
- **Git-ignored files** (e.g., files excluded from version control that contain environment-specific values)

## Approved Placeholder Data

Use these generic, cliche substitutes in all documentation and examples:

| Category | Approved Placeholder Examples |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **People** | Jane Doe, John Smith, Alice, Bob |
| **Email addresses** | `jane.doe@example.com`, `admin@example.org` |
| **Organizations** | Acme Corp, Contoso, Northwind Traders |
| **Domains** | `example.com`, `example.org`, `example.net` |
| **Addresses** | 123 Main Street, Suite 100, Springfield |
| **Phone numbers** | `(555) 123-4567` |
| **Accounts / usernames** | `demo-user`, `test-account` |
| **File paths** | `accounts/acme.mjs`, `config/reports.json` |
| **Project names** | My Project, Sample App, Demo Tool |

## How to Apply This Rule

### When Adding a Feature

If you add a feature using real account data (e.g., a script named after a real client), document the feature using a fictional account name instead.

**Real implementation file:** an account module configured for a specific business

**Documentation example:**

```javascript
// accounts/acme.mjs — Example account configuration
export default {
  name: 'Acme Corp',
  email: 'reports@example.com',
  folder: 'INBOX',
};
```

### When Updating Configuration Docs

If a config file references real domains, real paths, or real credentials, replace every real value with a placeholder before including it in documentation.

**Documentation example:**

```json
{
  "host": "imap.example.com",
  "user": "admin@example.com",
  "folder": "INBOX/Reports",
  "outputDir": "./downloads"
}
```

### When Writing Script Examples

If a script automates a task for a specific organization, the documentation example must use a generic organization name and generic parameters.

**Documentation example:**

```batch
@echo off
REM Example: Run the extraction task for Acme Corp
node extractEmail.mjs --account acme --task download
```

## The Boundary Between Code and Docs

| Context | Real Data Allowed? |
|---------|-------------------|
| Local scripts and config files used at runtime | Yes |
| Git-ignored files with environment-specific values | Yes |
| Prompt data provided to build or configure the tool | Yes (in code only) |
| README.md, docs/ folder, and example templates | **No — use placeholders only** |
| CHANGELOG.md entries | **No — describe changes generically** |
| Code comments in committed source files | **No — keep generic** |

## One Exception

A word from real data may appear in documentation **only** if it is a common English word used in its ordinary sense and **not** in the context of an example. For instance, the word "development" is acceptable in a sentence like "This tool is under active development" even if it also appears in a real organization name.

## Summary

Documentation is public. Implementation data is private. Keep them separate. Every example in every doc file should pass a simple test: *could a stranger read this and learn nothing about the real users, clients, or organizations behind this tool?* If the answer is no, replace the data with cliche placeholders.
